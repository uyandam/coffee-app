# Issues
- trying to find an online source to integrate the exchange rate microservice. This makes the microservice not work every once in a while
-- I no longer feel like creating another integration to deal with this issue. For all intents and purposes, I assume a constant exchange rate until I start dealing with the Foreign exchange microservice as a priority. This is for me to focus on other issues.
